"""
3a Consider the function find_median(numbers), which takes a list of numbers and returns the median.
 The median is the middle number, e.g. the median is 2 for the list [1, 2, 1000]. If the list has an even number of elements, the function should return the average of the two middle numbers. Formulate the requirements and acceptance criteria (AC) that should apply to the function.

3b Write test cases that test all ACs.

3c Implement the function so that all test cases are green.
